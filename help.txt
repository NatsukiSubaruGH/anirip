AniRip — v0.0.1 (beta1) Help Guide
Author: Natsuki Subaru
Release date: 12 Aug 2025

Purpose
AniRip is a PyQt6 desktop tool for finding and downloading anime episodes directly from AnimePahe’s API.
It’s designed to be simple to use, fast, and accurate, with parallel downloading and built-in asset caching.
It is intended for personal, educational, and lawful usage only.

1 — First Run Behavior (EXE version)
When you run AniRip for the very first time:

Silent Asset Download:

AniRip downloads the following files from its GitHub repo:

icon.ico → window/app icon (Windows-friendly)

icon.jpg → main background image

github.svg → GitHub button icon

reddit.svg → Reddit button icon

help.svg → help button icon

These assets are saved to a per-user cache folder:

Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\AniRip\assets\

Linux/macOS: ~/.anirip/assets/

Logging:

AniRip logs exactly where the assets are stored in assets.log (inside the assets folder).

Example log entry:

yaml
Copy
Edit
2025-08-12 14:02:45 | Asset cached: icon.ico → C:\Users\You\AppData\Local\AniRip\assets\icon.ico
Failure Policy:

If any required asset fails to download (network error, bad connection, missing file), AniRip will:

Log the error to assets.log

Exit immediately

This is intentional — you must have all assets before AniRip will function.

2 — Quick Start (Basic Usage)
Open AniRip.exe

Wait for the UI to load (assets will already be cached after first run).

Search for Anime

Enter a title in the search box.

Press Search → AniRip queries AnimePahe and returns up to 6 matches in a dropdown list.

Select Anime

Pick the anime from the dropdown.

Choose Language

JP Sub → Japanese audio + subtitles

Eng Dub → English dubbed version

Choose Quality

1080p

720p

360p
(Only sources that match the chosen quality are downloaded.)

Enter Episodes to Download
Supported formats:

all → All episodes

1-12 or range 1-12 → Continuous range

1,3,5 or list 1,3,5 → Specific episodes

5 → Single episode

Start Download

AniRip creates a folder named after the anime title (special characters replaced).

Episodes are downloaded in parallel (up to 10 at once).

The progress bar shows % of episodes completed (not bytes).

The log panel shows per-episode messages.

When Finished

All files will be in the anime’s folder in the same directory as AniRip.exe (unless run from another location).

3 — File Locations
Assets & Logs:

Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\AniRip\assets\

Linux/macOS: ~/.anirip/assets/

Files:

icon.ico, icon.jpg, github.svg, reddit.svg, help.svg

assets.log (asset download events/errors)

Downloads:

Current working directory → <Anime_Title>/

Example:

Copy
Edit
./One_Piece/One_Piece - Ep001 - 1080p.mp4
4 — Known Issues & Quirks (Intentional)
No asset = no app: Missing assets cause an immediate crash. This is by design.

Progress bar ≠ byte progress: It shows episodes completed, not file size progress.

Max 6 search results: Hardcoded for simplicity.

Parallel download cap: 10 workers max; going higher may cause bans from AnimePahe.

Episode validation: If you request episodes outside the available range, the download won’t start.

5 — Troubleshooting
Problem: “AniRip closes immediately on first run.”

Check assets.log in the cache folder.

If any asset failed to download, delete the assets folder and restart AniRip with a stable internet connection.

Problem: Downloads start but some episodes fail.

Check your internet connection; failed episodes must be retried manually.

Problem: “Search” returns no results.

Verify spelling.

AnimePahe may be down or API rate-limited.

Problem: Quality/language missing from list.

Not all anime have every resolution or language. Choose what’s available.
